    "Object detection is the process of identifying and localizing objects in an image. A typical object detection solution takes in an image as input and provides a bounding box on the image where an object of interest is, along with identifying what object the box encapsulates. But before we have this solution, we need to acquire and process a traning dataset, create and setup a training job for the alorithm so that the aglorithm can learn about the dataset and then host the algorithm as an endpoint, to which we can supply the query image.\n"

    "The object detection algorithm at its core is the [Single-Shot Multi-Box detection algorithm (SSD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325). This algorithm uses a `base_network`, which is typically a [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) or a [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385). The Amazon SageMaker object detection algorithm supports VGG-16 and ResNet-50 now. It also has a lot of options for hyperparameters that help configure the training job. The next step in our training, is to setup these hyperparameters and data channels for training the model. Consider the following example definition of hyperparameters. See the SageMaker Object Detection [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/object-detection.html) for more details on the hyperparameters.\n",

The following cell will train the algorithm. Training the algorithm involves a few steps. Firstly, the instances that we requested while creating the `Estimator` classes are provisioned and are setup with the appropriate libraries. Then, the data from our channels are downloaded into the instance. Once this is done, the training job begins. The provisioning and data downloading will take time, depending on the size of the data. Therefore it might be a few minutes before we start getting data logs for our training jobs.

This metric is a proxy for the quality of the algorithm. \n",
